Create VPC with this IP Address range  10.0.0.0/16

Create a subnet for public with this IP Address range - 10.0.1.0/24 
Create a subnet for public with this IP Address range - 10.0.2.0/24

While I am lacking in knowledge of subnet IP range specifications 
I learned that the smaller the number at the end the larger the number of ip's
The two subnets they have to be smaller ranges than the main vpc 

Make route tables now
set the publiuc route table to VPC
set the private route table to VPC

Create Internet Gateway by going to the VPC
then going to Internet Gateways and then go to Actions and select Attach to VPC

Go back to public route table 
Then edit it to support 0.0.0.0/0 for internet gateway
Then for the target choose internet gateway and select the newly create gateway
This will create an internet gateway for the public subnet where the webserver will be accessable

Attach Subnets to Routtables
Subnet > Actions > Edit Route Table Association

Go to the route tables and find the public route table
Actions > Set main route table

Then the important part to connect the subnets together is to to set the 
correct policy.

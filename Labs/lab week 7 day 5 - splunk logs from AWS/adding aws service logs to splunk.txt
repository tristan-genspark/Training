This will take a very long time running from scratch because
the logging is very slow

Now to configure AWS for S3 Access Logging

Go to the bucket

Go to properties

Go to Server access logging and edit it to be enabled

Then choose the bucket where you want to log the file to

Make sure its a different bucket and that its in the same region




Now creating a search string for billing

source="s3://*billing*" | search NOT "\"Cost\""="\"0.0000000000\"" | search NOT "\"Cost\""="\"*-*\"" AND NOT \"UsageEndDate\"=\"\" | table \"ProductName\",\"Operation\",\"RecordId\",\"InvoiceID\",\"Cost\",\"UsageEndDate\" | sort - _time | top 10

This search command will list the last 7 recent entries of finalized charges within within billing that are not 
equal to 0 and formats it in to a table arranged by the most recent entries

Some cost values were a date value instead of a number so this was filtered out.

I could not figure out how to remove the '\"' quotes in the raw data to therefore use the cost amount for graphs



Now creating a search string for bucket monitoring

source="s3://*" | search "monitored-bucket" | table RequestID, BucketName, HTTPMethod, RemoteIp, RequestURIPath, BytesSent | head 5

This search command will list the last 5 requests to the monitored bucket
It displays information about the request like the request type and the path as well as the number of bytes sent

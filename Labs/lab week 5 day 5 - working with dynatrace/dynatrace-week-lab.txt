1) Create a simple 2 node eks cluster and configure it also the SG
install Dynatrace agent on the nodes using kubernetes options
Create a simple dashboard on the Dyntrace potal to check the status of the cluster

Complete!

I created an EKS and nodes within it
I made sure to add the ssh option for the node group at the last step during the node group creation.

Then I went to AWS and opened up the cloud shell
and connected to the EKS just created with this command
aws eks --region us-east-2 update-kubeconfig --name Training_DynaTrace_EKS

I then create an agent on dynatrace and createed it as an openshift Agent
once creating the agent I made sure to select Kubernetes instead of openshift
and then I downloaded the dynakube.yaml file

Within the cloud shell I went to Actions then selected Upload File
and upload the dynakube.yaml file

One I did that I copied and pasted the commands it says to from the agent page on dynatrace

I had issues setting up this part before but after creating the nodegroup again with
clean security group rules the issue went away.

2) Deploy a simple application on k8s by creating different namespace and ensure the
application is monitored and dashboard and simple alerts are created

Complete!

I created nginx as the simple application on kubernetes within a namespace named test

 aws eks --region us-east-2 update-kubeconfig --name New-Cluster-1
 kubectl create namespace test
 kubectl run nginx --image=nginx -n test

 I was able to create an alert for the clusters memory if it exceeds 60%
 I was limited to the options I saw available so I was not sure if I could set CPU usage.

3) Deploy a simple web application on eks and synthetic monitoring

Created Nginx on the cluster using kubectl
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

I had difficulties getting the nginx visible from the internet

4) Deploy a simple web application on ec2 and synthetic monitoring
 Complete!

I went to Synthetic Monitoring
from the synthetic section chart I selected Create a Synthetic Monitor
and then selected Create a browser monitor
after that I entered the URL to the website I created on EC2
then I set the rate to be the default 15 minutes.
I was able to see the webpage show up on the dynatrace interface.

I have created the terraform files required to create a cluster with multiple nodes

I have integrated the terraform in to jenkins to build the infrastructure for deployment.

I did not get to the point of automating the loading of the container from ECR on this
but I believe I could if I had more time.

The application creation has been removed to make it easier to read.
The application creation process is shown in step 1.

Stage 1 Building

   Plan the infrastructure in terraform

Stage 2 Testing

   test the application before deployment

Stage 3 Deployment

  Create the infrastructure in terraform

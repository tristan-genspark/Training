My understanding of a Virtual Private Cloud


This is an isolated and abstracted private cloud service that is on demand.

Some of the benefits of a VPC is the ability to have better control over a network
including the subnets, ip ranges of the subnet and other configuration that may 
not be possible otherwise.

Each subnet can be assigned a avalability zone and this can be useful physical location making 
it have lower latency for a location.

Subnets within the VPS can have low latency communication with eachother even through they may be in different zones.

Multiple VPCs can be connected through VPC peering but it is important to have different subnet ranges.

There are multiple security components built in to configuring a VPC.
There is ACL that controls the virtual network layer and then there are security groups that 
control applications and services on the VPC.

Internet Gateways can be used to give your VPC access to the public internet.

Nat gateways can be used for subnets that are private to get access to the internet.
